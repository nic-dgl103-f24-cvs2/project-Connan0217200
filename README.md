<h1>Navigation Bar Optimization</h1> <p>The current navigation bar can be refined to offer clearer and more intuitive access to essential sections, such as the menu, ordering, smoker rentals, and contact information. A streamlined navigation menu will improve user flow and help customers find what they need quickly.</p>
<h1>Hero Section Enhancement</h1> <p>Introducing a hero section at the top of the homepage with a high-quality, mouth-watering image of the signature brisket will create an immediate impact. This section will feature bold and appealing text that highlights the authenticity and flavor of Big Brisket Barbecue, creating a memorable first impression.</p> 
<h1>Color Theme Update </h1> <p>The existing color scheme lacks the visual warmth and appetizing appeal typical of a barbecue brand. Updating to a richer, more cohesive palette that combines warm tones (such as browns, reds, and golds) will better reflect the barbecue theme and make the site more visually appealing.</p>
<h1>Image Quality and Placement</h1> <p>Replacing the current images with higher-quality photos will better showcase the smoky, savory appeal of the brisket and other dishes. The owner’s image can be resized to better balance the layout, and image alignment across the site will be adjusted to improve visual flow.</p>
<h1>Dedicated Menu Page </h1> <p>Moving the menu section to a dedicated webpage will make it easier for customers to browse offerings without distractions, allowing for clearer categorization, descriptions, and pricing of dishes.</p>
<h1>Revamped Contact Page</h1> <p> Enhancing the "Contact Us" page with a more visually appealing design and adding a contact form will make it easier and more inviting for customers to get in touch. Adding icons or visuals can also make this page more engaging.</p>
<h1>Additional Pages and Alignment Improvements </h1> <p> The "Order Brisket" and "Smoker Rental" options can be linked directly from the homepage and redesigned to ensure they’re more accessible and visually aligned with the main site theme.</p>
